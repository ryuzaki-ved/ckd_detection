To show step-by-step how the Neural Network model identifies Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Non-CKD for two patients, you can break down the process into multiple key stages. At each stage, you'll provide explanations, plot the relevant data, and display the results in an interactive or sequential manner.

Below, I will provide you with a structure of how to present each necessary step, from data pre-processing to predicting the class for two sample patients. I will also include inline comments to explain what is happening at each stage.

Steps Overview:
Load and Process Data: Clean and prepare the data.
Model Training: Train the Neural Network model.
Prediction for Two Patients: Make predictions for two sample patients (one CKD and one non-CKD).
Visualize the Predictions: Use plots to show how the network identifies CKD and Non-CKD.
Break Down the Prediction: Show intermediate outputs, such as the activation of layers and how the final prediction is made.
Let's break it down step-by-step.

Step 1: Load and Pre-process Data
We'll first load and pre-process the data, as we did in the original code. We'll also define two test patients (one CKD, one Non-CKD).

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn import preprocessing
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.layers import Dropout
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("kidney_disease.csv")
print(df.head())

# Pre-process the data (missing value handling, cleaning, encoding)
mode = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='most_frequent')
df_imputer = pd.DataFrame(mode.fit_transform(df))
df_imputer.columns = df.columns

# Clean specific columns
df_imputer['classification'] = df_imputer['classification'].apply(lambda x: 'ckd' if x == 'ckd\t' else x)
df_imputer['cad'] = df_imputer['cad'].apply(lambda x: 'no' if x == '\tno' else x)
df_imputer['dm'] = df_imputer['dm'].apply(lambda x: 'no' if x == '\tno' else x)
df_imputer['dm'] = df_imputer['dm'].apply(lambda x: 'yes' if x == '\tyes' else x)
df_imputer['rc'] = df_imputer['rc'].apply(lambda x: '5.2' if x == '\t?' else x)
df_imputer['wc'] = df_imputer['wc'].apply(lambda x: '9800' if x == '\t6200' else x)
df_imputer['pcv'] = df_imputer['pcv'].apply(lambda x: '41' if x == '\t43' else x)

# Encode categorical features
encode = df_imputer.apply(preprocessing.LabelEncoder().fit_transform)

# Split data into features and labels
x = encode.drop(['id', 'classification'], axis=1)
y = encode['classification']

# Resample to handle class imbalance
ros = RandomOverSampler()
X_ros, y_ros = ros.fit_resample(x, y)

# Normalize the features
scaler = MinMaxScaler((-1, 1))
X_ros = scaler.fit_transform(X_ros)

# Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction
pca = PCA(.95)
X_PCA = pca.fit_transform(X_ros)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_PCA, y_ros, test_size=0.2, random_state=7)
Step 2: Train the Neural Network Model
Now, we define and train the neural network. We will use the same neural network architecture as before, but we will add explanations as we go.

python
Copy code
# Define the neural network model
def model():
    clf = Sequential()
    clf.add(Dense(15, input_shape=(x_train.shape[1],), activation='relu'))
    clf.add(Dropout(0.2))
    clf.add(Dense(15, activation='relu'))
    clf.add(Dropout(0.4))
    clf.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
    clf.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return clf

# Instantiate and summarize the model
clf_model = model()
clf_model.summary()

# Train the model
history = clf_model.fit(x_train, y_train, validation_data=(x_test, y_test), epochs=20, verbose=1)
Step 3: Predict for Two Patients
Now, let's create two sample patient data. One will be a CKD patient, and the other will be a Non-CKD patient. These patients' features should match the format and range of features expected by the model.

Creating Sample Patients:
Here, we will create two synthetic examples. You would need to replace them with real data if available.

python
Copy code
# Example Patient 1: CKD patient (Synthetic Data)
patient_ckd = np.array([45, 90, 1.020, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 120, 35, 1.1, 140, 3.9, 14.5, 41, 9500, 5.1, 'ckd'])

# Example Patient 2: Non-CKD patient (Synthetic Data)
patient_non_ckd = np.array([60, 120, 1.035, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 90, 25, 1.0, 130, 3.7, 13.5, 39, 9000, 4.5, 'not ckd'])

# Preprocess patients (same as training data)
patients = pd.DataFrame([patient_ckd, patient_non_ckd])
patients = patients.apply(preprocessing.LabelEncoder().fit_transform)

# Normalize patient data (same scaler as training data)
patients = scaler.transform(patients)

# Use PCA to reduce the dimensions (same PCA as training data)
patients_pca = pca.transform(patients)

# Predict with the trained model
predictions = clf_model.predict(patients_pca)
print(predictions)
The predictions will be a value between 0 and 1. If it's closer to 1, it's more likely that the patient is CKD (since we are using sigmoid activation). If it’s closer to 0, it’s more likely that the patient is non-CKD.

Step 4: Visualizing Predictions (Visual Breakdown)
Now, let’s break down the process and visualize it. We’ll plot the output of each layer and show how the neural network makes its final decision.

python
Copy code
# For simplicity, we will visualize the output layer before and after sigmoid activation

# Define a custom function to extract intermediate layer outputs
from keras.models import Model

# Get the output of the second hidden layer (before final output)
intermediate_layer_model = Model(inputs=clf_model.input, outputs=clf_model.layers[2].output)
intermediate_output = intermediate_layer_model.predict(patients_pca)

# Plot intermediate outputs
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.heatmap(intermediate_output, annot=True)
plt.title("Intermediate Output of Second Hidden Layer (Before Sigmoid)")
plt.show()

# Now, let's look at the output after applying sigmoid
sigmoid_output = clf_model.predict(patients_pca)

# Plot the sigmoid output (predicted probability of CKD)
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
sns.barplot(x=['Patient 1 (CKD)', 'Patient 2 (Non-CKD)'], y=sigmoid_output.flatten())
plt.title("Predicted Probability (Sigmoid Output) for CKD and Non-CKD Patients")
plt.ylabel("Probability of CKD")
plt.show()

# Interpretation: If the value is closer to 1, it's predicted as CKD. If closer to 0, it's Non-CKD.
Step 5: Show the Final Decision and Breakdown of Prediction
Now, let’s show the exact decision-making process. We'll include details on the final output (probability of CKD), and we can provide metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to explain the model's performance.

python
Copy code
# Print the prediction result
if sigmoid_output[0] > 0.5:
    print("Patient 1 (CKD) predicted as: CKD")
else:
    print("Patient 1 (CKD) predicted as: Non-CKD")

if sigmoid_output[1] > 0.5:
    print("Patient 2 (Non-CKD) predicted as: CKD")
else:
    print("Patient 2 (Non-CKD) predicted as: Non-CKD")

# Display model evaluation metrics for the test set
y_pred = clf_model.predict(x_test)
y_pred = (y_pred > 0.5)  # Convert probabilities to binary labels

from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
